//Fireman's Aid Work Tasks

1. Hardware Assembly:
	Assembling all the hardware we have got and making sure that all the components are working fine comes under this task. This task can be completed in a single day provided all the components are present.

	1.1 :
		We need to make a can of water as our water source to put out fire. This job comes 	under here. Then we integrate it with the hardware above to make our perfect robot.


2. Code Uploading:
	Already present code needs to be uploaded to arduino uno using a serial cable and test it with the assembled hardware to make necessary changes to the code meeting our requirements.

3. Decoration:
	Nobody likes a robot who looks like a mess of electronics and wires. Its upto your creativity to make any nice decorations to the robot so that it appears beautiful to the eye.
4. Getting Ready with explanations:

	This is the most important step. We are not only required to make the robot , but also need to explain that to everyone who visits our stall. Need to discuss how and who are going to do the explanation part and also this is where most generally mess up, take into consideration your other duties for this task.

5. Anything I missed ? 
	Feel free to correct me and tell me your own ideas.
